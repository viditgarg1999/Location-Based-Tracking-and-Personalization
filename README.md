## Project Description and Goals
The problem which we are going to address via this project seems to be very hidden but needs immediate action. After reading the abstract, we get an idea that this project is doing something with the recommending the best deals and promos to the customers so that they can get the best out of their money and just to make that view even more clear, here are some pointers:
1.	They project is mainly concentrated on the location based tracking and personalization of passengers on airport.
2.	There are lots of websites available in the market that guarantees to provide the flight tickets at a cheap price, so in order to survive in this red sea we need to add something innovative that will improves the user experience exponentially.
3.	This system will track the location of the users with their permission and keep a track of how passenger prefer to spend their leisure time on the airport.
4.	The system will make a classification on the basis of age-group, gender, and flight type and then tries to figure out how the user would like to spend his/her time on airport.
5.	Once we able to get the above mentioned insights then we can display the best deals and promotions to the customer so that they can get the best out of their money.
6.	Finally the aim will be to visualize the results in a very friendly manner so that even a naïve user with not much knowledge about programming and analysis will be able to get the insights from the graphs.
